# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹
## ðŸ‘€ About Me  
I am an enthusiastic Honours Degree Student currently pursuing my Honours in Business and Financial Analytics at the Univeristy of the Free State. 

ðŸ˜„ I have a love for data and the way it can be manipulated, from the cleaning, to the feature engineering and then to the deployment of machine learning models and statitistical methods. Being able to take a bunch of numbers and give meaning to it drives me daily. I enjoy contributing to repositories I am apart of, better serving the community as a whole and contibuting towards my institution. I am skilled in python and C# programing allowing me to leverage these abilities with model deployment. 

ðŸŒ± Outside the world of work I enjoy playing sport like Soccer and Squash and also pursue other hobbies of mine such as playing guitar. Another major part of my life is my family and friends, where I try to dedicate a lot of my time. I have a love for travelling and will take any opportunity to travel somewhere.
